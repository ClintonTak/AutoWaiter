# AutoWaiter
A system that allows patrons of restaurants and bars to order food without having to interact with anyone. 

## Inspiration:

I was recently at a bar in Brno, Czech Republic, where they had a system where patrons could order from screens mounted in the tables and I was curious about what was happening behind the scenes to set up a system like that. I want to recreate the system in order to learn more about it and how it works. 

## Learning objectives:

Through this project I hope to polish up on my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming and data structures, as well as learn about distributed systems. 

## Key requirements of the system:

1. A menu of food and prices must be displayed to the user.
2. Users must have some way to select the food they want and send it to a different account, which also records which table they have ordered from.
3. The system must keep track of what the user has ordered and keep a running total of the cost.
4. The system must keep the different tables separate to accurately record what has been ordered where and what the total cost will be.
